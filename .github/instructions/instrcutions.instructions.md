We are building an application to track assets and create reminders for their maintenance and usage. The application will allow users to add, update, and delete asset information, as well as set reminders for important dates related to each asset.
The frontend has been developed using react and now we need to implement the backend functionality. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express, and it will interact with a database in aws to store and retrieve asset information.  
We need to add a login page which is not yet implemented. The login page should allow users to authenticate themselves before accessing the asset management features. The authentication will be handled using firebase authentication.
All the access keys, secrets, and other sensitive information should be stored in environment variables. The application should be designed to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users in case of issues.
The backend will also include a feature to read receipts in image or pdf format and extract relevant information from them. This will help users to easily add asset information without manually entering all the details. However once the receipt is uploaded, the user should be able to edit the extracted information before saving it to the database.
The frontend is build as a starting point and will be extended to include the new features as they are implemented in the backend. The frontend will communicate with the backend using RESTful APIs, and the backend will return JSON responses.
We need to store the asset information in a database hosted on AWS. The database should be designed to handle the asset information efficiently and allow for easy retrieval and updates. We will use AWS RDS for this purpose and we will use PostgreSQL as the database engine. The database schema should be designed to accommodate the asset information, including fields for asset name, description, purchase date, maintenance schedule, and any other relevant details.
The receipts will be stored in an S3 bucket on AWS. The backend will handle the upload of the receipts and store the file URLs in the database along with the extracted information. The application should also allow users to view and download the receipts associated with each asset.
We need to stick to the theme and design of the existing frontend application when extending any features. The new features should be consistent with the overall look and feel of the application, and should not disrupt the user experience. Even the login page should follow the same design principles as the rest of the application.
We need to keep in mind the color scheme, typography, and layout of the existing frontend when implementing the new features. The application should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
we should use relevant icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons to enhance the user interface and make it more intuitive. The icons should be used consistently throughout the application, including on the login page and in the asset management features.
The UI should be futureistic and polished to provide a seamless user experience. We should also consider accessibility features to ensure that the application is usable by people with disabilities.
Do not add any extra features or functionalities that are not mentioned in the requirements. The focus should be on implementing the specified features and ensuring that they work correctly.
Make sure you stick to the frontend design and functionalities which has already been implemented. The backend should support the existing frontend features and provide the necessary APIs for the frontend to function correctly.
Only if applicable we need to add features and compontents that are necessary for the backend to function correctly and support the existing frontend features. The focus should be on implementing the specified features and ensuring that they work correctly.
We need to make sure the website provides notifications to the user when certain actions are performed, such as successful login, asset creation, or receipt upload. The notifications should be clear and concise, providing feedback to the user about the action taken. For notification we can use a library like react-toastify to display toast messages on the frontend.

we will use aws bedrock model for receipt processing and information extraction.
We will use llamaparser for document understanding and information extraction using aws bedrock model.
